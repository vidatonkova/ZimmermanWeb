```bash
cd ZimmermanWeb
```
Next, you'll want to initialize the code inside of the files. Then run the code using the following the set of commands respectively (The "npm i" command will take a long time )
```bash
npm i
```
```bash
npm start
```
Next, you'll want to open up a new terminal and navigate to the folder you were just in
